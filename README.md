Easy to use Russian <-> English translator.
The main advantage is the widget on the desktop, for quick access and in case of authorization through Google account, the synchronization of words from the personal list.
The application from the start has over 2000 words in offline mode, which are easily supplemented by personal ones, which are also available without the network.
There is a voice of English words by their click *.

* - if TextToSpeech is installed.
